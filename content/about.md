Born and raised in Paderborn a city in west Germany. Get get my first computer with round 10 years and fell in love with it. After i finished my apprenticeship as Specialist for system integration at the university Paderborn. I want see the world and want to live in a big city so I moved to Berlin. There I start working as system administrator.

In my free time I do a lot of Sport. I did my first marathon already, let's see what comes next. But I also like to spent my time by digging into some computer stuff.
