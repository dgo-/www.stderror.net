I was born and raised in Paderborn in West Germany. I got my first computer at the age of 10 years and I fell in love with technology.  Therefor the apprenticeship as Specialist for System Integration at the university of Paderborn was a logical consequence. I then left my hometown and moved to the vivid city of Berlin where I am working as System Administrator.

In my free time I am dedicated to sports and I already absolved my first marathon. Letâ€™s see what next personal and professional experiences are next.
